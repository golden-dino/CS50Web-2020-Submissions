This repo contains 5 projects starting from project 0 to project 4:

0: Search

All are completed and accepted solutions. If you are only looking for the resources that you might need for completing the projects then you can take a look at the readme.md file placed in each folder, in the end of the file there is a list of resources that I used to complete the assignments. 

I am not going to mention the Final project: Capstone as it has to be done by the participant itself.
